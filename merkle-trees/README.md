# Merkle Trees
This repository contains implementation of the following Merkle Trees along with R1CS circuits implemented using [bellpepper](https://github.com/lurk-lab/bellpepper).

1. **Vanilla Merkle Tree** - circuit to verify membership 
2. **Indexed Merkle Tree** - circuit for insertion, checking membership and checking non-membership

All the trees use Poseidon hash function implemented by [Neptune](https://github.com/lurk-lab/neptune).
